	problem management. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in Bank of Ireland and gained a great deal of experience

          <p>My role at the start of my position in the Bank was to shadow other members of the incident management 
		  team to get a feel for the role while carrying out daily administration tasks related to the role. 
		  As the weeks placement progressed, the level of responsibility also increased and new duties included:</p>
		  <br/>
		
•	Being part of the incident management on call rota which entailed ensuring that any incidents 
raised out of hours had focus from the different vendor teams and ensuring the incidents were 
worked on until resolution.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Representing the incident management team on the following: daily problem/interlock call,
and monthly service monitoring call.

<br/>
<br/>
•	Representing the incident management team at CAB meetings, where potential changes to infrastructure and applications where discussed and either approved for implementation or declined.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Attending the weekly change related incident meeting, where incidents which were caused by changes where discussed.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Maintaining and updating a list to ensure that all incidents that are caused by changes are logged appropriately in the system.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Taking minutes and actions at meetings such as lessons learned meetings which would happen after significant and major incidents.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Being responsible for chairing governance meetings and minor incident management team meetings with the minutes and actions being sent to senior management.
<br/>
<br/>
•	Following incidents, deciding whether there was an outage or degradation of service record required from the vendors and ensuring the affected vendors took the correct action. 
<br/>
<br/>
•	Ticket management, which involved making sure that tickets assigned to different teams where been continually worked on.
<br/>
<br/>
I particularly gained good experience in problem management as this function is very closely entwinned with the incident management function.

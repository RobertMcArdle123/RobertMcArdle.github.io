		<p><h3>I am a mature student who after a few years working in maninly customer facing roles decided to go back to education in 2013. I started
		my return to education by doing a PLC in Game Desgin in Greenhills College, before moving on to the Institute of Technology Tallaght, where I am currently stuying IT Managment
		and will graduate with an honours degree in May 2018.
		</p></h3>
		
		<p><h3>I have an intrest in Technology which was the main reason I decided to puruse a career in this disciplne and also the fact of good career progression 
		available in this sector when I obtain a position after my studies.
		</p></h3>
		
		<p><h3>I have recently completed a 7-month internship in Bank of Ireland where I worked with the incident management team and gained experience working within 
		other teams such as service management and change management and a lot of my time was spent working with the problem management team. I thoroughly enjoyed my time 
		during my internship where I gained some key skills. A major aspect of this role was being part of the incident management on call rota as well as tasks such as chairing 
		governance meetings. I consider the experience I have gained during my internship along with the skills I have picked up during my time in college compliment my passion for the technology area.
		</p></h3>
		
		<p><h3>My favoruite subjects in college are networking and cloud computing and I hope to have a career in these these areas.
		</p></h3>
		
		<p><h3>I consider myself to be hardworking, thrustworthy, and ambitious. I can work well on my own or in a team and feel I would be an asset to any IT company.
		</p></h3>
		
		<p><h3>Although I hope to gain employment in a networking or cloud computing role I am willing to consider any graduate position on offer in the IT sector
		and am available to contact or for interview at any time.
		</p></h3>
		
		<b><h3>Outside of college I like sports, 
		technology, music and keeping fit. I play football for 
		my local team and am currently the team captain. I also 
		like to keep fit in the gym I have an interest in IT and 
		keeping up to date with the latest technology. </h3></b>
